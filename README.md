Explanation
The HTML code defines a simple web page with a container for the QR code image and a description text.

The CSS code defines a set of variables and styles for the web page, using the :root selector for defining variables and the *, body, and .card selectors for defining styles.

CSS is used to style the elements:
- The .container class sets up the overall layout of the page. It uses display flex to create a horizontal layout with equal spacing between the two
- The .container class sets up the overall layout of the page. It uses display flex to create a row layout with two columns. 
- The .container class sets up a responsive layout using flexbox. It centers its content vertically and horizontally.
- The .container class sets up the overall layout of the page. It uses flexbox to create two columns - one for the QR code
- The .container class sets up the overall layout of the page. It uses flexbox to distribute space between the two child elements evenly
- The .container class sets up the overall layout of the page. It uses display flex to create a horizontal layout with equal spacing between the two
